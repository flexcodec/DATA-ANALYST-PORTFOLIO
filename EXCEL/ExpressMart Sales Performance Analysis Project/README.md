Business Task/Problem:

I- Scenario:

ExpressMart, a retail and e-commerce business, has been successfully operating in multiple locations, including major cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Seattle, Portland, and Austin. Despite strong sales figures, the management team is keen on enhancing overall business performance by understanding customer purchasing behaviors, identifying sales trends, and optimizing operational efficiency.

II- Task/Problem Statement:

To achieve these goals, the management has identified several key areas that need detailed analysis and actionable insights.

My task was to leverage the provided sales dataset to address the following challenges:

1. Identify Peak Sales Periods:

- Analyze the sales data by hour, time of day (AM/PM), and month to determine when sales peak.
- Provide recommendations on how to optimize staffing and inventory management during these peak periods.

2. Top Performing Products:

- Determine which products are the top sellers and analyze the factors contributing to their success.
- Suggest marketing strategies to promote underperforming products.

  3.Regional Sales Performance:

- Compare sales performance across different cities.
- Identify cities with potential for growth and recommend targeted marketing campaigns or promotional activities.

  4.Customer Purchasing Behaviors:

- Analyze transaction data to uncover customer purchasing patterns.
- Provide insights into customer demographics and preferences to tailor marketing efforts and product offerings.

5. Sales Trends Analysis:

- Examine sales trends by month and quarter to understand seasonal variations.
- Propose strategies to boost sales during traditionally low-performing periods.

6. Sales Performance Dashboard:

- Develop a dynamic ‘Sales Performance Dashboard’ in Microsoft Excel that allows real-time tracking of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, quantity sold, and top products.
- Ensure the dashboard provides actionable insights for the management team to make data-driven decisions.
